                <strong>The title and topic of your site.</strong>
                <p>My site is about a fake restaurant, working title is "alexander's". Or maybe I will do one about a real restaurant still trying to decide (and based on what is allowed).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</strong>
                <p>I wanted to do a restaurant as topic because I've worked in the food industry for several years now I felt like a restaurant website is a great opporutunity to make a simple yet practical site that incorporates all of the concepts we have learned about in our class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homepage with business info, synposis of the restaurant and location.</li>
                    <li>Menu (table)</li>
                    <li>Chef Profile Page</li>
                    <li>Reserve a table (form)</li>
                    <li>History</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</strong>
                <p>The form will ask for customer information including time they will visit and party size, dining preferences, etc.</p>
                <p>The table will contain our menu with prices, along with ingredients of our dishes and allergen info.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</strong>
                <p>I will try to gain inspiration from existing restaurants. There's plenty of case studies and fake examples in business textbooks as well. I may also use AI to generate images as a backup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</strong>
                <p>Acknowledged</p>
