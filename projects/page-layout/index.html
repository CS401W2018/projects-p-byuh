            <h2>Notes on Nomads in the Indus Valley</h2>
            <p>Deep in the west Asian steppe between the Black and Caspian Sea, nomadic tribes such as the Vedic peoples migrated across Eurasia, bringing with them livestock, technological understanding, the Sanskrit language, and deep religious conviction. The Vedic people were able to migrate throughout the plains of South Asia out of the Indus Valley, and by 500 BCE they had settled well into modern-day India. The invention of the iron-bladed plow and development of rice crop cultivation allowed the Vedic peoples to become an agricultural-based society that would transform South Asia.</p>
            <p>Similar to South Asia, centralized societies began to emerge in East Asia between 1600 and 1200 BCE. The Shang dynasty, built on the agricultural and river-basin cultures of the Longshan peoples  became one of the predominant forms of political administration in the region. Mastery of metallurgy, also similar to South Asia, emerged in the Shang kingdom. Archeology suggests these people have both a strong “material culture” and “cultural development and aesthetic sensibility”. This also allowed them to contend with the rise of chariot warfare that was prevalent during this period.</p>
