                    <p>Danny Tanner is the loving and kind father of three daughters. As a morning show host and a bit of a neat freak, he brings structure and warmth to his family. This and his corny jokes with his big heart make him the ultimate TV dad.</p>

                    <p>Jesse Katsopolis is Danny's brother-in-law and the ultimate ''cool uncle''. He is probably best described by his love for Elvis and a rock musician personality that differentiates him from Danny. Despite his cool guy exterior, he has a big heart and deeply loves his family.</p>
