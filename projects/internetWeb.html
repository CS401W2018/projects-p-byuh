    <h1>Web Design Terms and Definitions | Pōmaikaʻi Jones</h1>
        <h2>Internet</h2>
            <p>A connection of numerous public networks from around the world communicating through a standard protocol.</p>
        <h2>Web</h2>
            <p>The system of websites or pages that users can access on the internet using a web browser.</p>
        <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
            <p>The internet is the means by how are all the different elements of the web (websites, email programs, etc.) are connected to eachother. In other words, the internet is the road the connects the different buildings, or websites.</p>
        <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
            <p>Each are character sets that can be encoded into a binary format. Unicode has characters and support for several languages, with each character represented by up to 4 bytes.</p>
            <p>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) only uses one byte per character, but only has support for the Latin alphabet.</p>
        <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
            <p>UTF is a version of Unicode with improvements and compatibility with ASCII.</p>
        <h2>URL</h2>
            <p>A Uniform Resoure Locator (URL), aka "web address" is director reference to a specific location on the internet.</p>
        <h2>Domain Name</h2>
            <p>The domain name is the unique identifier for a website (e.g. google.com), as opposed to address to a specific page.</p>
        <h2>HTTP</h2>
            <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol typically used on the internet to exchange information such as images or pages.</p>
        <h2>HTTPS</h2>
            <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) Works similarly to HTTP, but communicates through a secure and encrypted process.</p>
        <h2>IP Address</h2>
            <p>The number address for a specific device on a network.</p>
        <h2>DNS</h2>
            <p>Domain Name System (DNS) is a server and service that takes a given domain name and returns the associated IP address for that domain name. DNS is like a internet phonebook, returning the address when given a name.</p>
        <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Is a guide for best practices and webs standards that are used on the web to best optimize connected networks.</p>
        <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
            <p>eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a basic, universal structure for storing and sending data to different computer systems, such as a list of product prices to a webstore server. It also supports custom tags unlike HTML.</p>
            <p>eXtensible HTML (XHTML) can be described as "HTML in XML syntax", and designed to easily be used alongside XML. However, it does contain behaviors different from HTML.</p>
            <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML), compared to XMl, is a format specifically used for making content on web page that is meant to be shown in a web browser. An HTML document is comprised of elements, such as text and images, which are the content and metadata that makes up the web page. These elements are defined by different tags.</p>
            <p>HTML5 is basically an updated version of HTML with more advanced, accessible, and modern features; such as better support for different media formats and more logical semantic structure.</p>
