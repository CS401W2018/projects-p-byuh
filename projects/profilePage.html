    <h3>Now, a poem:</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Give me your tired, your poor,
        <br><br>Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
        <br><br>The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
        <br><br>Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
        <br><br><strong>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!</strong> <!--phrase element-->
