        <h2>What are Structural Tags?</h2>
            <h3>What goes in the header?</h3>
            <p>The header will typically contain the h1 tag, followed by the Navigational bar with nav tags.</p>
            <h3>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</h3>
            <p>The nav has links to other pages in your websites. Best practice is having the nav in your header, but it does not have to.</p>
            <p>It is also best practice to not have outbound links in your nav, but it still can.</p>
            <h3>What goes in Main?</h3>
            <p>Main should hold the <strong>dominant content</strong> of your webpage. This is the content built around the primary purpose the page was made for. This content should also be unique to the page, unlike navigational links or legal information.</p>
            <h3>What goes in the Footer?</h3>
            <p>The footer should hold content on your site that most users aren't looking for, but you still neeed to have. This is typically legal information, copyright notices, and links for internal users.</p>

        <h2>Why use Structure Tags?</h2>
        <p>Stucture tags help Google understand the layout, or structure, of our website. This organization is important for search engine optimization (SEO) as well as compatibility between devices and browsers.</p>
        <p>This is also helpful in making our website more accessible for individuals using assistive technologies like screen readers.</p>
