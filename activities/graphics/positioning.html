        <h2>Engagement Questions</h2>
        <h3>1. What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Normal flow is the default relative position of your web page elements before any styling is applied. Basically, the position is determined  by its location relative to other elements within the HTML file.</p>
        <h3>2. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
        <p>Float removes an element from the normal HTML flow, meaning the layout or position of an element is no longer dependent on its location relative to to other elements. For example, the flower image can be positioned to the right of this text body instead of only afterwards.</p>
        <p>In order to clear the float, use the ''clear'' styling command assigned to a class.</p>
        <h3>3. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Absolute: the postion of an element is not within the normal flow, but is assigned to a specifically defined area of the page.</li>
            <li>Fixed: This works similarly to absolute, except the positioning of the element is defined to an area of the user's viewport instead of the page. For example, a nav bar can be fixed to always show at the top of the screen even when scrolling throughout a webpage.</li>
            <li>Relative: changes to an elements relative position are applied after is current, normal flow position. For example, you can position an element 5px right of it's current, in flow position.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
        <p>You can make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices by having a compact nav bar fixed to the top or side of the screen. You could also only have the navbar show when the user click a button (ex: ''hamburger menu'') in order to hide the navbar when not needed, but have the button fixed.</p>
        <h3>5. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
        <p>All lecture notes and videos are on <a href="https://byuh.instructure.com/courses/1480439/pages/lecture-notes-css-and-box-model">Canvas > Lecture Notes</a>.</p>
